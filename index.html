        <span class="name">Fading Footprints:<br>A Tale of Lost Wildlife & Species on the Brink</span>
        Welcome to our interactive storytelling project, where data visualization meets conservation awareness. In this project,</br></br>

        We explore the profound impact of species extinction, using scrolly-telling drawing inspiration from *Reuters On the Brink*. </br></br>
        Using custom visualizations like flower glyphs to represent IUCN summary statistics, we highlight diverse and iconic species under conservation, showcasing the effectiveness of various measures. </br></br>
        Through immersive scrollytelling, we delve into the Yellowstone gray wolf case study, illustrating the ecological consequences of their extinction and the transformative changes following their reintroduction.

                <p>The Carolina Parakeet was a vibrant parrot native to the southeastern U.S., known for its green body, yellow head, and orange face. 
                  Extinction in the early 20th century was caused by habitat loss, hunting. 
                  Its loss is a stark reminder of human impact on biodiversity.</p>

                  Attempts to clone it in 2003 briefly revived the species, but the clone survived only a few minutes, making it the first species to go extinct twice.

  <span class="name">Custom Visualization: Flower Glyph Representation of IUCN Assessment Data</span> </br>
  <b>Overview:</b> This visualization uses summary statistics from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to present trends in species vulnerability over time. 
  The design combines traditional graph elements with a creative flower glyph to make the data more engaging and intuitive.
</br>
</br>
  <b>Axes:</b> </br>
  
  <b>X-axis:</b> Represents the year of assessment. </br>
  <b>Y-axis:</b> Represents the total number of assessments conducted in each year.</br></br>

  <b>Flower Glyph:</b>
  Each year is represented by a flower glyph. The petals symbolize specific subtypes of vulnerability (e.g., endangered, critically endangered), and their size reflects the number of organisms in each subtype.
</br>
</br>
  <b>Interactive Button:</b>
  A button at the top switches the Y-axis view from Total Assessments to Difference by Year, allowing users to explore yearly changes in assessments.
  </br></br>


  <b>Visual Design:</b>
  
  The flower glyph petals are color-coded by subtype for clarity.
  Hovering over a flower reveals a tooltip with detailed subtype data, enhancing the user experience with precise information.

          To understand the gravity of biodiversity loss, let us look at a case study from Yellowstone National Park. In the early 20th century, grey wolves were eradicated from the National Park due to extensive hunting and predator control programs. This triggered a cascading set of events which can be explored in a scrolly-telling visualization below.

        <p>The absence of grey wolves created an ecological imbalance and disrupted the local ecosystem. 
          Their reintroduction was vital to restoring balance, as wolves regulate herbivore populations, 
          allowing vegetation to recover, soil to stabilize, and biodiversity to flourish, ultimately 
          reviving the health of the entire ecosystem.</p>
